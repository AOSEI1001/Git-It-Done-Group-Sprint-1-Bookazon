# 📚 Bookazon

*Brought to you by **Git It Done: Ini, Tony, Pramithas, and Abisa***

## 🌟 The Vision

Once upon a repo, Bookazon was just a modest bookstore app. Simple, limited, a little “stinky” in design. But we saw more. Books were only the beginning. With the right refactor, Bookazon could become bigger, cleaner, and infinitely more extensible.

So we rolled up our sleeves, fired up GitHub, and transformed it. Today, Bookazon is no longer just about books — it’s about building a **scalable e-commerce platform** that can handle **audiobooks, DVDs, e-books, and beyond**.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Who We Are

We are **Git It Done** — a team that believes in solving problems, learning fast, and (occasionally) breaking main so you don’t have to.

What we gained:

* A solid grasp of Git workflows and teamwork.
* Respect for the SOLID principles (and the chaos when you ignore them).
* A cleaner, fun-to-work-on codebase that can grow with us.

## ⚡ Features We Added / Fixed

* **New Media Types:** Support for *audiobooks, DVDs, and e-books*.
* **Better Addresses & Subscriptions:** No more hacked-together strings — proper classes, reusable and maintainable.
* **Discount-Aware Orders:** Receipts now show detailed discounts, not just totals.
* **Refactored Design:** Reduced duplication, split bloated classes, applied SOLID.
* **Readable Code:** Removed “stink” (duplicated methods, magic values, primitive obsession).
* **Future-Proofing:** Adding new item types won’t require rewriting half the system.


## 🛠️ Tech Highlights

* Created extensible `MediaItem` structure for all product types.
* Added discount handling without breaking the `Order` model.
* Refactored `User` and `Cart` for clarity and single responsibility.
* Used UML diagrams to plan and communicate design changes.

## 📖 Lessons Learned

* Clean code saves time in the long run.
* GitHub is powerful when you use branches and PRs properly.
* Collaboration beats coding solo — especially when someone catches your bug in review.
* “Git It Done” isn’t just our name, it’s our philosophy.
